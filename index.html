  <h1>To You, From My Heart</h1>

  <p>I‚Äôm really sorry if I made you feel like I only care about your body. That was never my intention, but I understand why it might have felt that way. Honestly, I feel ashamed of myself. I hate the thought that I‚Äôve hurt you or made you feel used.</p>

  <p>The truth is, I‚Äôve been feeling really lonely. I just want to feel like I matter to someone‚Ä¶ like I can make someone happy and be wanted in return. But I see now that I went about it the wrong way, and it ended up hurting you. That‚Äôs the last thing I ever wanted to do.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm also sorry for the times I‚Äôve misunderstood you, especially when you weren‚Äôt in a good mood. I know I‚Äôve made things harder, and I regret that. But please know this you‚Äôre not a problem to me. You never were. I come from a toxic environment, but with you, it doesn‚Äôt feel worse. It actually feels better.</p>

  <p>I know we‚Äôve been getting better, and there are fewer arguments between us now. That‚Äôs progress, and I want to continue building on it, with more understanding and love.</p>

  <p>I need you, but not in a selfish way. I need you because I love you. I want to be someone who brings peace, not pressure. Someone who supports you and makes you feel truly loved. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve fallen short of that. I‚Äôm going to do better, for you and for us.</p>

  <p>I want to bother every single thing about you in the sweetest way. I want to know everything. Your thoughts when you can‚Äôt sleep, the little things that make you smile, the ones that make you upset. Please let me bother you, let me love you that deeply. Tell me everything. I want it all, because it‚Äôs you.</p>

  <p>This isn‚Äôt the end for us. I won‚Äôt give up on you, and I never will.</p>

  <p><strong>With love,<br>Jen the Kacak Men & Nana the Destroyer</strong></p>
